#  Uncrowdify Project

## Overview

Uncrowdify allows to limit number of people in the store by scheduling their visits to particular time slots. This will help to "uncrowd" the store so shoppers can keep social distance.

1. Store managers (from large chains to mom and pop stores) enter/upload their participating locations - addresses and their capacity (number of people that each store can fit safely with Coronavirus in mind). 

2. Then shoppers can see available stores with open time slots near them and reserve a time slot. The app generates onscreen QR code for the visit.

3. At the store entrance, a store clerk scans QR codes from users' screens with Scan portion of the app. If they come within scheduled interval, they are let in right away. All other customers stand in line to enter as they do now. They will be allowed to enter with second priority when capacity allows.
